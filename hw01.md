# CSC751 Semantic Web

[Assignment 1][1] by George J. Pavelka on January 23rd 2020 (late delivery)

1. _Please describe the purpose of the Semantic Web in your own words._

  * The purpose of Semantic Web is to add semantically structured knowledge, e.g. to extend web content with meaning and relationships so that besides humans even machines can understand it.

2. _We have learned that the Semantic Web provides a conceptual framework to solve the prior problem with three different components (building models, computing with knowledge, and exchanging information). Describe each component and convince us that the combination of these three components provides a solution to the problem._

  * Having complex data models with relationships, being able to reason and exchange allows for machines to understand web content.
    * Building models -- using simple language for expressing data models, which refer to objects and their relationships.
    * Computing with knowledge -- using processes similar to human deductive reasoning and inference.
    * Exchanging information -- a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused.

3. _Is it possible for an agent in the properly designed Semantic Web to contain human level intelligence?_

  * In terms of understanding content, web semantics can understand content even more explicitly than humans and infer much deeper consequences. That does not mean it to become actually better in human way of understanding the content.

4. _What is the outcome of the 2016 paper on a new look of the Semantic Web?_

  * Talking about current state of Semantic Web and how it's gonna evolve in future 10 years. Semantic Web is going to improve in representation and lightweight semantics, it's going to focus on heterogeneity, quality and provenance and discover latent semantics and work over big data.

5. _We have talked about Semantic Web for a bit. But what about semantic technologies? Semantic Web is realized through semantic technologies. Describe how it is realized._

  * Resource Description Framework (RDF), a general method for describing information
  * RDF Schema (RDFS)
  * SPARQL, an RDF query language
  * N-Triples, a format for storing and transmitting data
  * Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)
  * Web Ontology Language (OWL), a family of knowledge representation languages
