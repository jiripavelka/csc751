# CSC751 Semantic Web

[Assignment 2][1] by George Pavelka on January 23rd 2020

1. _First, download Prot´eg´e from http://protege.stanford.edu/. Use the desktop version, not the web version. Second, download the Prot´eg´e-OWL-Tutorial, available on our class web page. The document contains a practical guide to build OWL ontologies using Prot´eg´e 4 (you are using version 5.5, some adaptation is necessary) and CO-ODE tools. In order to answer the following questions you need to read approximately 100 pages from this document, and model the pizza ontology as described in the document. The document is based on Prot´eg´e’s default reasoner HermiT. Create a PDF-compiled LaTeX document that contains the answers to the following questions and upload it into the mentioned folder._

    1. _What is an OWL ontology? What are the components within an OWL ontology? Briefly describe them._

    #TODO

    2. _What are named classes? What are disjoint classes?_

    #TODO

    3. _Briefly describe the characteristics of the following properties:_

        * Inverse properties
        * Functional properties.
        * Inverse functional properties.
        * Transitive properties.
        * Symmetric properties.
        * Asymmetric properties.
        * Reflexive properties.
        * Irreflexive properties.
    
    4. _Describe briefly the notion of existential and universal restrictions._

    #TODO

    5. _What kind of services are offered by an OWL-DL reasoner?_

    #TODO

    6. _What are “necessary”, and “necessary & sufficient” conditions?_

    #TODO

    7. _Describe two reasoning instances that come across during the building of the pizza ontology. Explain the reason behind those inferences._

    #TODO

    8. _What is “Open World Reasoning” and “Closed World Reasoning”?_

    #TODO

    9. _What is “Unique Name Assumption”?_

    #TODO

2. _Now it is time for you to create your own ontology. In this assignment you only need to model an ontology that covers at least ALC expressivity. You will extend this ontology in forthcoming assignments until you may reach SROIQD expressivity. First, you need to select a domain to model an ontology. These are some of the domains that you may consider: vehicles, universities, stock exchange, language, computers, animals, birds, games, sports, social networks etc. You may choose another domain of your liking as well of course. Your ontology should contain at least 20-50 concepts, 5-10 object properties, 5-10 data properties, and an appropriate number of individuals. Please use the Prot´eg´e editor to model the ontology, and make sure that the ontology is consistent. You can use the RDF/XML or OWL/XML format to save the ontology_

You will be given 5 minutes in class to present your ontology on February 20th. Please upload the owl file to the public html folder off of your home directory. This way we can all access the OWL file and use it as a piece of well-defined knowledge on the Internet.

3. _Is there any inferred knowledge in the ontology that you have modeled? Show us at least five complex axioms, and intuitively explain the reason for the inference._
