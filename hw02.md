# CSC751 Semantic Web

[Assignment 2][1] by George Pavelka on January 23rd 2020

## Question 1

_First, download Protégé from http://protege.stanford.edu/. Use the desktop version, not the web version. Second, download the Protégé-OWL-Tutorial, available on our class web page. The document contains a practical guide to build OWL ontologies using Protégé 4 (you are using version 5.5, some adaptation is necessary) and CO-ODE tools. In order to answer the following questions you need to read approximately 100 pages from this document, and model the pizza ontology as described in the document. The document is based on Protégé’s default reasoner HermiT. Create a PDF-compiled LaTeX document that contains the answers to the following questions and upload it into the mentioned folder._

1. _What is an OWL ontology? What are the components within an OWL ontology? Briefly describe them._

  * OWL ontology is a standardized way (from W3C) to describe concepts in a domain and relationships that hold between them. 
    * Individuals = objects in the domain.
    * Properties = binary relations between individuals.
    * Classes = sets of individuals.

2. _What are named classes? What are disjoint classes?_

  * Named classes form hierarchy of classes under a root class of `Things`.
  * Disjoint classes is a set of classes that cannot share same individual.

3. _Briefly describe the characteristics of the following properties:_

  * Inverse properties link same pairs of individuals in different order.
  * Functional properties link at most one individual to an individual.
  * Inverse functional properties are combination of inverse and functional properties.
  * Transitive properties P(a,b) and P(b,c) infer P(a,c).
  * Symmetric properties P(a,b) infer P(b,a).
  * Asymmetric properties P(a,b) cannot infer P(b,a).
  * Reflexive properties must infer P(a,a).
  * Irreflexive properties must not infer P(a,a).
 
4. _Describe briefly the notion of existential and universal restrictions._

  * Existential restrictions to a class require its individuals to be paired by a property with _some_ individuals from another specific class.
  * Universal restrictions same but _only_ instead of _some_.

5. _What kind of services are offered by an OWL-DL reasoner?_

  * Computing the inferred ontology class hierarchy and checking for consistency on an ontology.

6. _What are “necessary”, and “necessary & sufficient” conditions?_

  * Necessary conditions on class must be applied in order to consider an individual a member of that class.
  * Necessary & sufficient conditions on a class when met are good enough to infer an individual belonging to that class.

7. _Describe two reasoning instances that come across during the building of the pizza ontology. Explain the reason behind those inferences._

  * _CheesyPizza_ being able to infer members right away based on existential restriction `hasTopping some CheeseTopping`.
  * _VegetarianPizza_ requiring to create a closure on toppings before being able to infer members `hasTopping only (CheeseTopping or VegetableTopping)`.

8. _What is “Open World Reasoning” and “Closed World Reasoning”?_

  * Open world reasoning assumes unknown knowledge.
  * Closed world reasoning infers only based on its data.

9. _What is “Unique Name Assumption”?_

  * Two individuals cannot be considered as a same subject.

## Question 2

_Now it is time for you to create your own ontology. In this assignment you only need to model an ontology that covers at least ALC expressivity. You will extend this ontology in forthcoming assignments until you may reach SROIQD expressivity. First, you need to select a domain to model an ontology. These are some of the domains that you may consider: vehicles, universities, stock exchange, language, computers, animals, birds, games, sports, social networks etc. You may choose another domain of your liking as well of course. Your ontology should contain at least 20-50 concepts, 5-10 object properties, 5-10 data properties, and an appropriate number of individuals. Please use the Protégé editor to model the ontology, and make sure that the ontology is consistent. You can use the RDF/XML or OWL/XML format to save the ontology_

  * Plugins
    * The structure can be simplified into a list of plugins. Some plugins are mandatory (the system cannot run without them).
    * Additionally each plugin has specific complexity index. That determines its initial cost and its maintenance / development fee.
  *  Features
     *  There is a hierarchy of supported features that may require specific plugins or other features. Some features are incompatible with static environment.
     *  Additionally each feature has its usual setup difficulty. That determines its setup cost and influences the maintenance / development fee.
  *  Websites
     *  Each website instance consists of plugins inferred from specified subset of features.
     *  Additionally there are three types of necessity -- must, should and nice to have.

_Is there any inferred knowledge in the ontology that you have modeled? Show us at least five complex axioms, and intuitively explain the reason for the inference._

  * Required plugins per website and necessity.
  * Set of features supported by required plugins.
  * Total complexity and setup difficulty for each website instance.
  * List of features incompatible with static environment.
  * List of features that do not require any plugin.
